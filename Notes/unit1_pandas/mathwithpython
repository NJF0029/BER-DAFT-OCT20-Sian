1. Where do we start to use python - can use a text editor / command line - but Jup notebook allows you to execute one line at a time more easily, visualisation is better 
Options to work in python : 
Python in term   Python3 
Anaconda  launch manually and open New or existing 
Jupyter notebook in command line 

Class create — Python scratch pad 

Int_1 =1
Int_2 = ‘2’ 
Play with maths + - 
To turn int_2 into #2 = int(Int_2) 

Float_1 = 1.0 
Float_2 = 2
Float_3 = 3.
type(float_2)
type(float_3)

String_1 = ‘3.141592'
String_2 = 'I want some pie'
print('i saw', String_1, 'and now', String_2)
Boo_1= True
print(Boo_1)
print(type(Boo_1))

True and false are reserved key words- can’t be used as variable names 
2. By the way, where are we working now? Remember pwd from Bash?

Import os 
cwd = os.getcwd()
print (cwd)

3. Lets do some sums to get comfortable with python 

Print (10*10)
10**10 (10 the power of 10) 
10>100
10<100
10-10
10==10
10/10
10+10
Print(sqrt(100)) - doesn’t work as sqrt isn’t in our inbuilt python library of functions 
So : import math as m 
Print(m.sqrt(100)) 
print(m.pi)
QU HOW CAN I show this sentence with pi to 15 dp 
I saw 3.141592653589793 and now I want some pie
